# Multilingual-Tweet-Intimacy-Analysis
The main dataset has been collected from SemEval 2023 Task 9: Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis challenge which consists of a set of tweets in six different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, and Chinese) that have been annotated with intimacy ratings between 1 and 5. Alongside this dataset, we have also used a question intimacy dataset of Reddit. Deep learning and transformer-based models have been used to analyze the intimacy of these datasets.
